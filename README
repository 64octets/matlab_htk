Unforuntately this has not been very thoroughly tested, *but* it has
been working for me.  If anyone wants to write some unit tests using
http://mlunit.sf.net or something similar I won't say no.

In addition to whats listed here, I have some (matlab only and matlab
+ C) code to do a Viterbi decode of a factorial HMM.  Is anyone
interested in this?


* Functions

They are all reasonably commented...

 - The important ones:
   - train_hmm_htk - use HTK to train an HMM
   - train_gmm_htk - use HTK to train a GMM
   - eval_gmm      - find the posterior probability of a gmm given data

 - Utility functions:
   - read_htk_hmm  - read in an HTK HMM definition (text format only)
   - write_htk_hmm - write an HMM structure as an HTK HMM definition
   - compose_hmms  - does FSM composition to form a big HMM from many
                     small HMMs (i.e. get an HMM to recognize a
                     sentence from a bunch of phone HMMs).

 
* Data Structures

The functions in this toolbox pass around the following structures:
Note: all probabilities are stored as log probabilities

** GMM
  - gmm.nmix   - number of components in the mixture
  - gmm.priors - array of prior log probabilities over each state
  - gmm.means  - matrix of means (column x is mean of component x)
  - gmm.covars - matrix of covariance (column x is the diagonal of the
                 covariance matrix of component x)

** HMM with GMM observations
  - hmm.name          - 
  - hmm.nstates       - number of states in the HMM
  - hmm.emission_type - 'GMM'
  - hmm.start_prob    - array of log probs P(first observation is state x)
  - hmm.end_prob      - array of log probs P(last observation is state x)
  - hmm.transmat      - matrix of transition log probs (transmat(x,y) 
                        = log(P(transition from state x to state y)))
  - hmm.labels        - optional cell array of labels for each state in the HMM
                        (for use in composing HMMs)
  - hmm.gmms          - cell array of GMMs 

** HMM with Gaussian observations
  - hmm.nstates       - number of states in the HMM
  - hmm.emission_type - 'gaussian'
  - hmm.start_prob    - array of log probs P(first observation is state x)
  - hmm.end_prob      - array of log probs P(last observation is state x)
  - hmm.transmat      - matrix of transition log probs (transmat(x,y) 
                        = log(P(transition from state x to state y)))
  - hmm.labels        - optional cell array of labels for each state in the HMM
                        (for use in composing HMMs)
  - hmm.means         - matrix of means (column x is mean of state x)
  - hmm.covars        - matrix of means (column x is the diagonal of the
                        covariance matrix of component x)

Note that each row of exp(hmm.transmat) does not necessarily sum to 1
because for each state x there is some probability
(exp(hmm.exit_prob(x))) that the next transition will be to a
non-emitting exit state (i.e. the current observation is the last
observation in the sequence).  The correct invariant is:
sum(exp(hmm.transmat, 2)) + exp(hmm.exit_prob) == ones(hmm.nstates, 1)
